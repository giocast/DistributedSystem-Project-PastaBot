# DistributedSystem-Project-PastaBot
Distributed System Project for Bachelor Course of Software Engineering at Politecnico di Bari.

Two possibile interactions:
- Recommendation ingredients-oriented: provide a set of dishes by filtering a menu with respect of dishes ingredients
- Recommendation image-oriented: provide pasta dishes with a certain level of similarity 


INGREDIENTS-ORIENTED RECOMMENDATION STEPS:
1) User emotion acquisition (ask for user actial mood: Happy üòÅ, Neutral üòê, Sad ‚òπÔ∏è, Angry üò°)
2) User preferences acquisition (which ingredients the user likes, dislikes or is allergic to). This step is personalized according to the mood
3) Recommendation based on preferences: identification and selection of pasta dishes of a menu which respect the provided conditions. Share also the ingredients of the selected dish and a friendly human-like recommendation to the user.

IMAGE-ORIENTED RECOMMENDATION STEPS:
